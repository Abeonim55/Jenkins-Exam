# Jenkins Exam - DevOps Bootcamp - 22/08/2025

This repo is my exam submission for the Jenkins CI/CD sprint.  
The Jenkins pipeline builds and deploys the `movies` and `casts` FastAPI microservices with PostgreSQL databases on Kubernetes, using Helm.  

The original README (below) is kept for reference but is not relevant for this deployment setup.
